# Cardano for Salesforce

![](documentation-and-images/Cardano-for-Salesforce-thumbnail.png)

Cardano for Salesforce is an open source solution for using the Cardano Network to send and receive payments into Salesforce. Cardano for Salesforce monitors the blockchain, so it  should work with any popular Cardano wallet users want to use.

This will be an independent open source Salesforce app, as well as an addition (v2.0) to ADA Wallet for Salesforce, which we developed for Catalyst Fund 13 and is available from the following sources. 
* A free commercial app [listed on the Salesforce AppExchange](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=48f0a214-c854-4d22-80b8-33e42042b3f4)
* A [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MuKnSys/ada-wallet-for-salesforce)


Web3 Enabler’s [Blockchain Payments](https://web3enabler.com/product/blockchain-payments) product supports UTXO models as well as Account models, which gives us the experience and core tools to bring over to Cardano for Salesforce.
